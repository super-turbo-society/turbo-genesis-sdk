A flexible Rust SDK for building WebAssemblyâ€“powered games on the [Turbo](https://docs.turbo.computer), with first-class support for graphics, audio, input, and netcode.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Install Turbo

   ```sh
   curl -sSfL https://turbo.computer/install.sh | sh
   ```

   Make sure you also have the wasm target installed as well

   ```sh
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```

   You can find full install instructions on the [Turbo Docs](https://docs.turbo.computer/learn/installation)

1. **Create your project**

   ```bash
   turbo init my-turbo-app
   ```

   This will automatically add the SDK as a dependency in your project's `Cargo.toml`:

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   turbo = { package = "turbo-genesis-sdk", version = "*" }
   ```

   The SDK version will vary based on the version of `turbo` installed. It is best to ensure your on the latest version of `turbo` and the SDK when starting a new project.

1. **Write your code**
   Open `src/lib.rs` and drop in:

   ```rs
    use turbo::prelude::*;

    turbo::go!({
        // Clear the background with a hex color:
        clear(0xff00ffff);
        // Draw text to the screen:
        text!("Hello, Turbo!");
        // Draw a rotated square:
        rect!(w = 50, h = 50, color = 0xffffffff, rotation_deg = 45);
    });
   ```

1. **Run with Turbo**

   ```sh
   turbo run -w .
   ```
